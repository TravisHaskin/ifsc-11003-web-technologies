    <h2>Exploring the Red Planet: Your Guide to NASA's Mars Rovers</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the ultimate resource for understanding NASA's pioneering fleet of Mars rovers! Since the landing of Sojourner in 1997, these mobile laboratories have been our eyes, ears, and hands on the Martian surface, revolutionizing our understanding of the Red Planet. This FAQ section addresses common questions about the missions' objectives, the technology that allows these incredible machines to operate millions of miles from Earth, and the groundbreaking discoveries they have made in the search for evidence of ancient life and the history of water on Mars.</p>

  <h2>General Mission & Rationale</h2>
<details class="faq-item">
  <summary class="faq-question">Q: What is the main objective of NASA's Mars rovers?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    A: The primary goal has evolved over time, but generally, it is to search for evidence that Mars may have once had conditions favorable for life, particularly by investigating the history of water on the planet. Current rovers like Perseverance are actively searching for signs of ancient microbial life and collecting rock and soil samples for a potential future return to Earth
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary class="faq-question">Q: What are the names of NASA's Mars rovers?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
      A: NASA has successfully landed and operated five rovers on Mars:
      <ul>
        <li>Sojourner (1997)</li>
        <li>Spirit (2004-2010)</li>
        <li>Opportunity (2004-2018)</li>
        <li>Curiosity (2012-Present)</li>
        <li>Perseverance (2021-Present)</li>
      </ul>
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary class="faq-question">Q: Why use rovers instead of stationary landers?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
      A: Rovers offer significant advantages over stationary landers, as they can examine a larger territory, be directed to features of scientific interest, and position themselves optimally for power (e.g., to maximize sunlight for solar panels).  </div>
</details>

<h2>Rover Operations and Technology</h2>
<details class="faq-item">
  <summary class="faq-question">Q: How do the rovers move around on Mars?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    A: Most of NASA's Mars rovers have six wheels and use a specialized suspension system called a rocker-bogie system, which allows them to climb over obstacles and traverse rough terrain safely. They use computers (the "brains") to process information and can drive autonomously with instructions sent from Earth
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary class="faq-question">Q: How are the rovers powered?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    A: The older rovers like Spirit and Opportunity were powered primarily by solar panels that convert sunlight into electricity, stored in rechargeable batteries. The larger, newer rovers, Curiosity and Perseverance, use a Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG), which converts the heat from the natural decay of a radioactive material (Plutonium-238) into electricity, providing reliable power even during Martian dust storms or winter.
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary class="faq-question">Q: How do scientists communicate with the rovers?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    A: Communication occurs via radio signals between the rover on the Martian surface and ground stations on Earth. The data is often relayed through NASA orbiters circling Mars (like the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter or Mars Odyssey) to increase the speed and volume of data transfer.
</details>

<h2>Key Discoveries & Future Plans</h2>
<details class="faq-item">
  <summary class="faq-question">Q: What is the biggest discovery made by the rovers?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    A: One of the most significant findings, confirmed by the Mars Exploration Rovers (Spirit and Opportunity) and further elaborated by Curiosity, is that Mars was likely much wetter and warmer in its ancient past, with conditions that could have been hospitable to microbial life. Curiosity, for example, definitively answered that Gale Crater once contained the necessary chemical ingredients for life.
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary class="faq-question">Q: What is the ultimate goal of the Perseverance rover mission?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    A: Beyond seeking signs of ancient life, Perseverance's unique goal is to collect and cache promising samples of rock and regolith (broken rock and soil) in sealed tubes. These samples are intended to be picked up by a future mission (the Mars Sample Return campaign, in partnership with the European Space Agency) and brought back to Earth for detailed study in terrestrial laboratories.
