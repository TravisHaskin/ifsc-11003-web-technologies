    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The NASA Mars rover program is a pioneering effort to explore the Red Planet using robotic vehicles designed to traverse its surface and conduct scientific experiments. Beginning with Sojourner in 1997, the program has since launched a series of increasingly advanced rovers, including Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance. Each mission has contributed vital data about Mars’ geology, climate, and potential for past or present life.</p>

        <h2>Sojourner</h2>
        <p><em>Launched on December 4, 1996</em></p>
        <p>This pioneering mission marked the first successful rover deployed to the Martian surface. Its data collection proved the viability of mobile exploration on another planet.</p>

        <h2>Spirit (MER-A)</h2>
        <p><em>Launched on June 10, 2003</em></p>
        <p>Spirit was part of the Mars Exploration Rover program, designed to study the history of water on Mars. It far outlasted its planned operational life, returning extensive geologic information.</p>

        <h2>Opportunity (MER-B)</h2>
        <p><em>Launched on July 7, 2003</em></p>
        <p>As the twin of Spirit, Opportunity focused on searching for evidence of past water activity and habitability. It holds the record for the longest distance driven by any vehicle on another celestial body.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <h2>Curiosity</h2>
        <p><em>Launched on November 26, 2011</em></p>
        <p>Curiosity's primary goal has been to assess if Mars ever had an environment capable of supporting microbial life. It is equipped with a sophisticated suite of instruments for chemical and environmental analysis.</p>

        <h2>Perseverance</h2>
        <p><em>Launched on July 20, 2020</em></p>
        <p>This modern rover is actively seeking signs of ancient microbial life and collecting critical rock and soil samples. Perseverance also carried the Ingenuity helicopter, demonstrating powered flight on Mars.</p>
