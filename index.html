    <h2>Progressive Enhancement Reflection</h2>
    <p>	Progressive Enhancement is a perspective in web design in which a developer chooses to make the content of their work accessible to all users, regardless of browser, internet connection, etc. It primarily focuses on the content itself and implementing it into an accessible website. While the graceful degradation perspective focuses on prioritizing newer/more capable browsers and neglecting older/less capable ones, the progressive enhancement perspective does the opposite: it begins with ensuring that its content is accessible on the simpler/more dated browsers and then it makes changes and improvements as it reaches the more modern/complex browsers. In other words, it starts with the basic foundation and builds up.</p>
    <p>	The progressive enhancement is an important perspective to consider when designing a website. The internet is a vast place with many different users accessing it in various ways. Not everyone has access to the latest technology or the fastest internet connection, so it is crucial to ensure that the content of a website is accessible to as many people as possible. By prioritizing accessibility and usability, developers can create websites that are inclusive and user-friendly for all visitors.</p>
    <p>	Overall, the progressive enhancement is a valuable perspective in web design that prioritizes accessibility and usability for all users. By focusing on the content itself and ensuring that it is accessible to everyone, developers can create websites that are inclusive and user-friendly.</p>

    <h2>Mars Rover Project and Reflection</h2>
    <p>In order to spot some of the problems and imperfections on the unfinished version of my final project, I asked my mother to take a look at it so that I could have a fresh set of eyes to point out any details that I may have missed and to develop stylistic ideas that I would not have been able to come up with on my own.</p>
    <p>One of the main issues that was brought to my attention was that the font sizes on my site were inconsistent and seemed to vary on each page. In addition, my mom claimed that the text was a bit too small and hard to read at times. She, among many others in my family, is far-sighted and has difficulties seeing small text up close. This is a common occurrence umong users and is an important thing to acknowledge when it comes to building sites and making them as accessible as possible. After receiving this feedback from my mother, I made sure to adjust the font sizes and make them more consistent.</p>
    <p>Another issue that I was made aware of is the inconsistencies with the logo placement on each page. For the home page, I had adjusted the logo to move closer to the right side of the page in order to not obstruct the background image and, when making the rest of the pages, I just copied that same style. However, since I changed the background image for each page, it made the repositioning of the logo seem more and more pointless with each proceeding page. After noticing this, I went back and adjusted it to make the logo appear in an appropriate position on each page.</p>
    <p>Overall, this feedback allowed me to gain a new persepctive on the project and realize some issues that I had overlooked previously. It always helps to have a fresh set of eyes on something you're working on because it can be easy to overlook and miss your own faults when you're not searching for them. I thought that this was a valuable use of my time and it allowed me to work even harder to put forward the best product I could.</p>
